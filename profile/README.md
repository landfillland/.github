You may choose to become happy—but happiness is not something you are owed.

You may also choose to accept judgment, yet it fills you with fear.

When trapped in such a dilemma, you can only feel that, in truth, you have no real choice at all.

But suppose you *must* choose.  
Suppose you can truly see two distinct paths laid out before you,  
rather than walking blindfolded down a single road into darkness—  
then, at that moment…  

What would you choose?

The age of uncertainty has come to an end.  
The era of drifting illusions and sorrowful compassion has passed into history;  
the age forged by a single fool is now over.  

The horizon is no longer narrow, and the clouds that once covered half the sky have thinned.

Starlight has dimmed, and sunlight no longer shines so brightly.

Her greatest wish, bound as she is,  
was to suffer in agony atop a cliff of despair—  
yet such a wish will never be fulfilled.  

Instead, she was granted the right to choose.
